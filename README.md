# AI Dock

AI Dock is a lightweight Electron shell that keeps your favorite AI assistants in one secure desktop window. Each AI service runs inside its own BrowserView tab and isolated session so logins stay separated.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The project uses `electron-builder` to produce a Windows NSIS installer.
